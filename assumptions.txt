Below are assumptions that were used during the development of the view module
1) Terrain is fixed, ie terrain will never change throughtout the course of 
the game
2) Buildings however may change color?  I think it is best to leave building
as a unit since that will make it easier to draw
3)The following shapes will be used for representing units:
  Circle - Tank
  Square - Ocamlry
  Triangle - Infantry

The following convention will be used to indicate the position of a unit: 
 __ __ __ __ ___ __ 
|0,4|1,4|2,4|3,4|4,4|
|0,3|1,3|2,3|3,3|4,3|
|0,2|1,2|2,2|3,2|4,2|
|0,1|1,1|2,1|3,1|4,1|
|0,0|1,0|2,0|3,0|4,0| 

should be pretty self-explanatory
